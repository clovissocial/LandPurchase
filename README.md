# Land Detector

This is a design project for B-Tech.
Land Detector is aimed at solving the problem of individuals who buy fake lands.

Land Detector comes in to help individuals see legit lands available, get in contact with the owners and potentially buy those lands

The interested buyer can then contact the owner through the site for more enquiry and possibly purchase the land directly on the site
